# toxic-chess
A toxic chess bot, meant to terrorize you while playing chess IRL.

### Running it

Note: **I would not run this on your own.** Many things ended up only working for my setup, so it's gonna be a buggy mess if people try it on their own.

I need to create a `requirements.txt` file in the future, but for now here's the packages that the program uses:
```
python-chess
gtts
cv2
flask
numpy
dataclasses
```
This list might not be complete.

You also need a file titled `insults.json` in the insults folder, containing an array of insults.

This will probally not work if you ran it yourself, unfortunately I made it tailored to the specific setup I had.
